# This is the RPC section, for the airspyhf component. The idea is
# that any change to any of the `airspy_*:request` values will trigger
# a publication of that value. Upon receipt the component will execute
# the corresponding function with the given parameters (if any), and
# return any return values in the 'airspy_*:reply' value. That's the
# idea, anyway. The AirspyHF component will have to have a dedicated
# thread to respond to these publications. It will use the internal
# thread in the airspyhf library to publish IQ data over its
# conection.
#
# Multiple devices are supported. An API function that supports a
# specified device, on unpacking the request list, will treat the
# first element as the serial number.
